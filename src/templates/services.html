        <p class="paragraph"><span>CLEANING MASTER</span> is a house cleaning service that provides the right service and the right price. Whether you are looking for a weekly, bi-weekly, monthly or one-time cleaning, our mission is not only meeting your expectations but
          exceeding them. Receive an instant estimate of the total time and cost of your house cleaning service by inserting your requirements. 100% customer satisfaction is not only our goal but a guarantee. All of our trained professionals are ready
          to provide the best service, whether it's a basic cleaning, regular weekly cleaning, or even detailed move-out/move-in cleaning.</p>
        <h5 class="paragraph__title">How will the house cleaner know my priorities?</h5>
        <p class="paragraph"> If it's your first time booking an appointment with the house cleaner, be sure to review the scope of work outlined on this page before your appointment so you know what's included in a typical cleaning. Plan to be available to review your cleaning
          preferences and priorities when your pro arrives. This will help ensure your pro spends their time cleaning the parts of your home that matter most to you. Any special requests should be discussed before the service appointment begins, as some
          requests are not included in a standard cleaning and may result in an updated service price.</p>
        <h5 class="paragraph__title">How many hours should I choose?</h5>
        <p class="paragraph"> Hours are listed in labor-hours, meaning that a four-hour appointment could either be one pro working for four hours or two pros working for two hours. The price estimate shown above is based on the number of total cleaning hours. Our suggested
          cleaning time is based on information we gathered from our providers using the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to estimate the total size of the home. We give a recommendation based on your inputs but you should choose the number of hours you
          believe best suits your needs.
